    "**Variable** is any symbol or Lambda expression that will acts as a parameter for the function. In pure untyped Lambda calculus,  symbols do not have any special meaning or type by they own. Meaning is extracted from the functional application. Untyped systems have some advantages related to universality but that usually comes with a performance penalty.\n",

    "<blockquote>Calchylus is far from being beneficial for heavy arithmetic processing. Rather, it is meant for inspecting theoretical foundations of arithmetics, programming languages, and logic.</blockquote>\n",

    "**Function abstraction** consists of:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. a function identifier, usually denoted by a Greek lambda letter `𝜆` or `λ`\n",
    "2. an argument and a body delimitted by a symbol that is usually a dot `.` or a middle dot `·`\n",
    "3. parentheses for grouping an abstraction (and possibly body components) `()` or sometimes `[]`\n",
    "  \n",
    "<blockquote>Due to the fact, that a dot belongs to the reserved symbols in Hy language, a dot will be escaped in the following examples like this: `\\.`</blockquote>\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, Lambda function must have one and only one argument. At first, this seems very restricting, but in reality with a technique called *currying* multiary functions can be constructed. In other words, any number of arguments can be transformed to the single argument style expressions, and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "The body of the function will be the first expression after the delimitter. Body expression can be a parenthezised set of symbols or just a single symbol, where parentheses or a space before and after the symbol indicates the start and the end of the body.\n",

    "**Function application** is a function abstraction together with an applicable variable / parameter. In many programming languages this is same as defining an anonymous function and applying it to the given argument(s).\n",

    "### Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Calchylus module is not just for presenting Lambda calculus notation in different forms, but also for evaluation (beta-reduction) of the Lambda expressions. Evaluation process has some principles that are good to know:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. evaluation process starts, when a parameter is given to the *function abstraction*\n",
    "2. evaluation starts from the left-most parameter that is passed to the left-most function in the same level\n",
    "3. evaluation continues passing free parameters from the left to the functions according to the principle 2.\n",
    "4. when the normal form of the expression is achieved, meaning it cannot be further reduced, then reduction is once more started for sub expressions of the normal form, until head normal form is achieved\n",

    "Consequence of this is that:\n",

    "5. parameters are substituted to the body before they are evaluated\n",
