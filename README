Calchylus - Lambda calculus with Hy
=====================================

`Calchylus` is a [Hy](http://docs.hylang.org) module that is used to evaluate,
and furthermore, to understand the basics of Lambda calculus (also written as
Î»-calculus).

<blockquote>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus">Lambda calculus</a>
  is a formal system in mathematical logic for expressing computation based on
  function abstraction and application using variable binding and substitution.

	$ pip install hy calchylus
	$ hy

.. code:: lisp

	> (require [calchylus.lambdas [*]])
	> (with-alpha-conversion-and-macros L ,)
	> (L x y , (x (x (x (x (x y))))) a b)
	(a (a (a (a (a b)))))
	> (FIBONACCI FIVE)
	(x (x (x (x (x (x (x (x (x (x (x (x (x y)))))))))))))
