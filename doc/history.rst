Historical perspectives
=======================

Notation and ideas of differentiable functions comes from the 17th century
mathematician Gottfried Leibniz. Early functions dealt with the continuous
change of the values. By the 20th century, functions were generalized to map
between any two sets, inputs and outputs.

Lambda calculus was invented by
`Alonzo Church <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonzo_Church>`__ in the 1930s.
That happened actually a decade before modern electrically powered computers
were created. Lambda calculus can be described as the simplest and the smallest
universal Turing complete programming language.

In mathematics, functions are often seen as graphs. In the Lambda calculus,
functions are seen as formulas and rules instead. It is a system for
manipulating functions as expressions.

LISP (LISt Processor) 1.5 was specified in 1958 by John McCarthy. It is the
second oldest language after FORTRAN (FORmula TRANslator), both currently in use.

In February 1991, van Rossum published the codebase for Python version 0.9.0.

Hy, that is meant to operate as a transparent Lisp front end to Python's AST,
was introduced at PyCon 2013 by Paul Tagliamonte.

``calchylus`` Lambda calculus module was programmed with Hy by
Marko Manninen, 08-09/2017.
