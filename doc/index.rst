Calchylus - Lambda calculus with Hy
===================================

``calchylus`` is a `Hy <http://docs.hylang.org>`__ module that is used to
evaluate, and furthermore through this documentation, shine light to the basics
of Lambda calculus (also written as λ-calculus).

.. note::

	`Lambda calculus <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus>`__ is a
	formal system in mathematical logic for expressing computation that is
	based on function abstraction and application using variable binding and
	substitution.

The target audience is those who:

a) are interested in the theory and the history of the programming languages
b) may have some experience in Python and/or Lisp
c) who wants to narrow the gap between mathematical notation and
   programming languages, especially by means of logic

`Andrew Bayer <http://math.andrej.com/2016/08/30/formal-proofs-are-not-just-deduction-steps/>`__
writes in his blog post:

	Traditional logic, and to some extent also type theory, hides computation
	behind equality.

Lambda calculus, on the other hand, reveals how the computation in logic is
made by manipulation of the Lambda terms. It also addresses the problem, what
can be proved and solved and what cannot be computed in a finite time.

``calchylus`` can also serve as a starting point for a mini programming language.
Via custom macros representing well known Lambda forms, ``calchylus`` provides
all necessary elements for boolean, integer, and list data types as well as
conditionals, loops, variable setters, mathematical operators, and exemplary
arithmetic functions like, summation, factorial, and fibonacci. Finally, one
can expect to get a good understanding of combinatory logic, not the least of
the fixed point combinator or shortly, ϒ combinator:

$$\\Large ϒ = 𝜆x.(𝜆y.x \\space (y \\space y)) \\space (𝜆y.x \\space (y \\space y))$$
