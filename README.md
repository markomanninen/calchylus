# Calchylus - Lambda calculus with Hy

`Calchylus` is a combination of [Hy](http://docs.hylang.org) macro and Lambda terms dictionary. It was written to help to write, evaluate, and understand Lambda calculus.

<blockquote><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus">Lambda calculus</a> is a formal system in mathematical logic for expressing computation based on function abstraction and application using variable binding and substitution. -<i> wikipedia.org</i></blockquote>


At the current development stage, `Calchylus` does not provide alpha conversion and beta [reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus#Reduction) stages of terms as an output. `Calchylus` provides just the direct evaluated result via the `ùúÜ` macro.
